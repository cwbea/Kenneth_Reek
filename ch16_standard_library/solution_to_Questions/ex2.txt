The numbers produced by the rand() function in C are not truly random ‚Äî they are pseudorandom.

That means:

    They are generated by a mathematical formula, and if you start with the same seed, you'll get the same sequence every time.

üîç So... are they any good?

Yes, they are "good enough" for many everyday uses, such as:

    Games

    Simple simulations

    Shuffling cards

    Practice programs

But they are not good enough for:

    Cryptography (e.g. password generation, encryption keys)

    Security-sensitive applications

    Scientific simulations requiring high-quality randomness

 Why not use rand() for security?

Because rand() is predictable if someone knows (or guesses) the seed value. An attacker could reproduce your "random" numbers.
 Better alternatives?

Yes! Depending on your needs:

    For more secure randomness, use:

        arc4random() (on BSD-based systems)

        getrandom() or /dev/urandom (on Linux)

        rand_s() (on Windows)

        Or a library like OpenSSL

    For better pseudorandom numbers in modern C:

        Use the Mersenne Twister via <random> in C++11

        Use libraries like GNU Scientific Library (GSL)

 Summary:
Use Case	Is rand() OK?
Simple game	    Yes
Card shuffling	    Yes
Cryptography	    No
Lottery system	   No
Academic simulation	Maybe
