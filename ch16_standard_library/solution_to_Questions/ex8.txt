How qsort uses the comparison function:

    The comparison function tells qsort how to order two elements.

    It returns:

        A negative value if the first element is less than the second.

        Zero if they are equal.

        A positive value if the first element is greater than the second.

What if the comparison function returns the opposite values?

    So, if you swap the signs, it means:

        Returns positive when first < second.

        Returns negative when first > second.

What would happen?

    The sorting order would be reversed.

    Instead of sorting ascending, the array would be sorted descending.

    So yes, it does change the behavior of qsort by changing the order of elements.

In short:
Normal comparison	Resulting order
Negative if a < b	Ascending order
Positive if a > b	Ascending order
Opposite signs	Resulting order
Positive if a < b	Descending order
Negative if a > b	Descending order
Summary:

    The actual values don’t matter — only their sign.

    Swapping signs flips the sort order.

    qsort will still work correctly, but it will sort in the reverse order.
