here is no difference in what the expressions do (both move the pointer p forward by 3 elements),
 but there is a minor difference in how the compiler evaluates them.


p += offset; uses a variable, so it requires loading offset at runtime.

p += 3; uses a constant, which is slightly easier for the compiler to optimize.
