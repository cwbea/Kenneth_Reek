The compiler will try to convert the expression to the declared return type. 
This is called implicit type conversion or type coercion.
If the conversion is safe (e.g., from int to float), it usually works fine.

If the conversion is unsafe (e.g., from double to int, or from a pointer to an int),
you may lose data or get a compiler warning or error, depending on the context and compiler settings.
