In ANSI C (C89/C90), function prototypes are not strictly required, 
but they are strongly recommended. However, if a function is used 
before it's defined, and no prototype is declared, the compiler 
assumes it returns an int and attempts default argument promotions. 
This can lead to bugs or undefined behavior, especially with functions 
that return other types or take arguments of types other than int, char, or float. 
For any real, maintainable, or collaborative project, not using prototypes is a disadvantage.
