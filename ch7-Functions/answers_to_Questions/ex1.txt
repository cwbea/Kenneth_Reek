A stub is a placeholder function that allows the rest of the program to compile
and run, even though the function is not yet implemented.
Empty stubs are a good starting point, but making them print messages, 
return dummy values, or log calls makes them far more useful during testing,
debugging, and collaboration—so you know where the gaps are and what’s being called.
