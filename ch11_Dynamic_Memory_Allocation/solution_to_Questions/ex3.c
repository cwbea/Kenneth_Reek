Yes, there is a logical value for the size of the input buffer when reading strings from a fileâ€”but it depends on context and trade-offs.


Common Logical Buffer Sizes:

    Line-Based Input (e.g., fgets)
    Use a buffer large enough to hold the longest expected line plus the null terminator:

#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024
char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

    1024 is a common default.

    If you expect very long lines (e.g., logs or CSVs), increase it.

    Too small = truncated lines.

    Too large = wasted memory (especially in loops or recursion).

Block-Based Input (e.g., fread)
A multiple of the disk block size (typically 512 or 4096 bytes) is efficient.

#define BLOCK_SIZE 4096
char buffer[BLOCK_SIZE];

Dynamic Approach
If you donâ€™t know the max line length, use getline() (POSIX) or write a reallocating loop. It dynamically grows the buffer:

    char *line = NULL;
    size_t len = 0;
    getline(&line, &len, file);  // line is allocated/resized as needed

ðŸ“Œ General Guidance:

    For fixed buffers: start with 1024 or 4096 bytes.

    For unknown-size input: use dynamic allocation (e.g., getline).

    Avoid hard-coded small values (like 80 or 128) unless you know the input limits.
