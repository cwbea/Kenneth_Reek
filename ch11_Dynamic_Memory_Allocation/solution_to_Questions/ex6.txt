Yes, allocating arrays dynamically can help minimize stack space usage, and here's why:
‚úÖ 1. Arrays: Allocate Dynamically to Save Stack Space

When you declare an array locally (on the stack), like this:

int arr[100000];  // 100,000 ints = ~400 KB on the stack

    You're using a large chunk of the limited stack space, which is often restricted (e.g., 8MB by default on many systems).

    This can cause stack overflow in deep recursion or with large arrays.

But if you dynamically allocate the array on the heap:

int *arr = malloc(100000 * sizeof(int));

    The memory comes from the heap, which is typically much larger than the stack.

    This helps avoid stack overflow and keeps the stack frame small.

‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Scalars (e.g., int, char, float)

For simple scalars like:

int a;
char b;

    These take up very little space (4 bytes for int, 1 byte for char).

    Allocating them dynamically like:

int *a = malloc(sizeof(int));

... adds overhead (pointer + heap metadata) and is less efficient.

üîΩ So for scalars:

    Do not allocate dynamically unless you specifically need to share them, keep them beyond scope, or interact with APIs requiring pointers.

‚úÖ Summary:
Variable Type	Stack or Heap?	Recommendation
Large Arrays	Heap (use malloc)	‚úî Helps minimize stack usage
Small Scalars	Stack (normal usage)	‚úî More efficient unless special circumstances
