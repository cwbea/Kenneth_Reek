1. The entire function squares() will be commented out and ignored by the compiler, 
   and nothing will happen when you call squares().

2. Advantages
   i. Simplicity for small projects.
   ii. Faster compilation for small projects.
   iii. Fewer files to manage.
   iv.  Quick debugging.

   Disadvantages
  i. Program becomes progressively harder to maintain, navigate and navigate as the source
     files becomes larger in size.
 ii. Lack of modularity.
 iii. Longer recompiling time.
 iv.  Poor readability.
 v.   Difficult collaboration.

3. printf("\"Blunder\?\?!\?\?\"");

4. Escape Sequence	Decimal Value 		ASCII Representation
   \40			32			' '
   \100			64			@
   \x40			64			@
   \x100		256			platform depedent
   \0123		83			s
   \x0123		291			beyond standard ASCII
  
5. int xy

6. There is nothing wrong, however Case, If and while look like C keywords 
   except that their first letters are capital letters, this can cause confusion.

7. False because it greatly affects human readabiity and improper use of semicolons, indentations
   and braces can cause logic errors especially in control flow statements.

8. Both are correct, Program 1 is easier to read because it follows good formatting practices
   like proper indentation, clean layout and one statement per line.

9. gcc main.c list.c report.c -o myprogram 
   This creates an executable file called myprogram

10. gcc main.c list.c report.c -o myprogram -lparse
   -lparse tells the linker to link your program with the libparse library.
    By default, it looks for a file named libparse.a or libparse.so in standard library paths like /usr/lib.

11. Only list.c needs to be recompiled.
    You're only changing its implementation hence it doesn't affect headers or other files.
