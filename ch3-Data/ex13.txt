In Fragment 1 (with const):

   The variable a is initialized with a value (25), and once assigned,
   its value cannot be changed anywhere in the program. 
   Any subsequent attempt to modify a will result in a compilation error.

In Fragment 2 (with const):

    The declaration const int a; without initialization is invalid.
    A const variable must be initialized at the time of declaration.
   If you don't initialize it, the compiler will give an error because 
   const guarantees that the variable will not change once it is set, 
   and it must have an initial value when declared.

    So, Fragment 2 would result in a compilation error unless it is modified to also initialize a when declared:
