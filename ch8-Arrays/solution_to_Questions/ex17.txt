int const b[]

is exactly the same as:

int const *b

Which means:

    b is a pointer to constant integers.

    You cannot modify the elements that b points to

Example:

void function(..., int const b[]) {
    b[0] = 42; // ❌ ERROR: can't modify value pointed to by a const pointer
    b++;       // ✅ OK: pointer itself is not const
}

Use 		| int const a 				| int const b[] or int const *b

Applies to 	| A single integer, passed by value 	| An array of ints, passed as a pointer
Const protects  | The value (copy) of a 		| The data being pointed to (not the pointer)
Modifying inside| Not allowed 				| Not allowed to change data b[i]
Usefulness 	| Mostly stylistic/documentation 	| Very useful for read-only arrays
