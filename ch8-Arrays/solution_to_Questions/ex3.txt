data[1] == *(data + 1) == *(actual_data - 1 + 1) == *actual_data == actual_data[0]

The author wants to write data[1] to access actual_data[0], i.e., to create the illusion of 1-based indexing.

 it invokes undefined behavior (UB), even though data[1] might work as expected.

In C and C++, pointer arithmetic is only valid within the bounds of the same array object,
 or one past the end. Accessing before the start of the array is undefined behavior, 
even if you donâ€™t dereference that address.
