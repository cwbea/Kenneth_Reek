Statement 2 is the correct and safer choice:

if (which < SIZE && array[which] == 5)

Here's why:
ðŸ’¡ Why does this work safely?

C uses short-circuit evaluation in logical &&:

    In if (A && B), if A is false, B is not evaluated.

    So, in which < SIZE && array[which] == 5, if which is out of bounds, the array is never accessed.
