    Efficiency and Optimizations:

 Both functions use pointer arithmetic in their assembly, but the performance 
difference between try1 and try2 might be minimal. Both use similar optimizations such
 as adjusting the pointer (rdi) directly to move through the array.

try1 seems to have a slightly more straightforward approach in terms of logic 
because it adds the value before moving the pointer.

try2 increments the pointer first, then accesses the value, which is a small 
difference but could affect performance depending on the compiler optimizations.


    Stack Usage:

Both functions make use of registers (%eax, %rdi, %rsi, and %rdx) efficiently 
and avoid unnecessary stack operations. They both rely on pointer-based loops, 
which minimizes overhead compared to indexed array access.

    Function Prologue/Epilogue:
Both functions follow a similar pattern of using a prologue (testl, movslq, xorl) and epilogue (ret) 
to manage the function setup and return.

Conclusion:

Both try1 and try2 are efficient in terms of using pointers for array access. 
The difference between the two is likely negligible in terms of performance, 
and both would likely perform similarly in most practical scenarios.

If your goal is to optimize for performance in tight loops, pointer arithmetic generally 
performs slightly better than array subscripting. However, modern compilers often optimize 
both in similar ways, especially when the optimization level is set to -O2 or higher.
