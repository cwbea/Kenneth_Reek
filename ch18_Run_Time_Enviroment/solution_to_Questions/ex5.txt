Yes, it can be implemented. This is exactly how modern systems like Linux x86_64 already work: the System V AMD64 ABI passes 
the first 6 integer/pointer arguments and first 8 floating-point arguments directly in registers (rdi, rsi, etc.), avoiding 
unnecessary stack use. This is done by the compiler, which generates code to load arguments into the appropriate registers 
before calling the function.
