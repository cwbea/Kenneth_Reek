you're taking an important safety step by reserving space for the null terminator. But there's a small detail that matters here.
    strncpy copies up to BSIZE - 1 characters from some_other_string into buffer.

    If some_other_string is shorter than BSIZE - 1, it will pad the rest with '\0' bytes.

    If it's equal to or longer, it will not null-terminate the destination string.

⚠️ Potential Problem:

If some_other_string has BSIZE - 1 or more characters, buffer will not be null-terminated, 
leading to undefined behavior when you use it as a C string (e.g., in printf, strlen, etc.).
✅ Correct and Safe Usage:

To make sure buffer is always null-terminated, add this line right after:

buffer[BSIZE - 1] = '\0';

This guarantees that the last byte is '\0', even if the input string is too long.
