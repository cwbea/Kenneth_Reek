 * Function: dll_insert
 * --------------------

 *
 * Parameters:
 *   rootp - A pointer to the root (dummy) node of the list.
 *   value - The integer value to be inserted into the list.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   1  if the value was inserted successfully,
 *   0  if the value is already in the list (no insertion),
 *  -1  if memory allocation for a new node fails.
