pros - Slightly more streamlined code flow if you assume every call inserts a node.

Cons:

    Unnecessary memory allocation if the value is already in the list.

        For example, if next->value == value, the function returns 0, but the newnode has already been allocated.

        This leads to a memory leak since that memory is never freed.

    The allocated node might never be used.

    This breaks the assumption that every malloc is paired with a use or a free.
