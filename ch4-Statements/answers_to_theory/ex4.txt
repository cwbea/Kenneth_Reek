Sometimes, you want to do nothing when a condition is true, but do something when it's false.

if (condition)
{
    // do nothing
}
else
{
    // statements when condition is false
    printf("Condition is false!\n");
}

An alternative way in doing this would be to use a negated condition with no else

if (!condition)
{
    // statements when condition is false
    printf("Condition is false!\n");
}
