Step 1: Build the BST (assuming insertion order)

    Start with 54 (root)

    Insert 36 (left of 54)

    Insert 72 (right of 54)

    Insert 22 (left of 36)

    Insert 16 (left of 22)

    Insert 41 (right of 36)

    Insert 25 (right of 22)

    Insert 25 (duplicate, usually ignored or placed consistently; let’s ignore duplicates for clarity)

    Insert 80 (right of 72)

    Insert 61 (left of 72)

    Insert 51 (left of 61)

    Insert 73 (right of 72, left of 80)

The tree structure looks like this:

        54
       /  \
     36    72
    /  \   /  \
  22   41 61   80
 /  \       /    \
16  25    51     73

Step 2: Traversals
Pre-order (Root, Left, Right):

54, 36, 22, 16, 25, 41, 72, 61, 51, 80, 73
In-order (Left, Root, Right):

Sorted order for BST

16, 22, 25, 36, 41, 54, 51, 61, 72, 73, 80

Wait — note 51 is left child of 61, so it comes before 61

Correct in-order:

16, 22, 25, 36, 41, 51, 61, 54, 72, 73, 80

But that’s not correct because 54 is root, so in-order should be:

Left subtree of 54:
16, 22, 25, 36, 41
Then 54
Then right subtree:
51, 61, 72, 73, 80

So in-order:

16, 22, 25, 36, 41, 54, 51, 61, 72, 73, 80
Post-order (Left, Right, Root):

Left subtree (36):
16, 25, 22, 41, 36

Right subtree (72):
51, 61, 73, 80, 72

Then root: 54

So full post-order:

16, 25, 22, 41, 36, 51, 61, 73, 80, 72, 54

Breadth-first traversal (Level order):

Level 1: 54
Level 2: 36, 72
Level 3: 22, 41, 61, 80
Level 4: 16, 25, 51, 73

So:

54, 36, 72, 22, 41, 61, 80, 16, 25, 51, 73
Summary:

Traversal	Order
Pre-order	54, 36, 22, 16, 25, 41, 72, 61, 51, 80, 73
In-order	16, 22, 25, 36, 41, 54, 51, 61, 72, 73, 80
Post-order	16, 25, 22, 41, 36, 51, 61, 73, 80, 72, 54
Breadth-first	54, 36, 72, 22, 41, 61, 80, 16, 25, 51, 73
