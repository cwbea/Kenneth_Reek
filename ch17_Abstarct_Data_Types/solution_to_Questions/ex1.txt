The most appropriate Abstract Data Type (ADT) for this task is a Stack.
 Reason:

A Stack follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.
So, if you push each name onto the stack as you read it, and then pop each name when printing, 
the names will be printed in reverse order.

 Example:

Input:  Alice, Bob, Charlie

Push Order (stack top to bottom): Charlie → Bob → Alice

Pop and Print: Charlie, Bob, Alice
