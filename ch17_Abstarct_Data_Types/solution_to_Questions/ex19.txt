The most appropriate traversal for implementing the destroy_tree function (i.e. deleting/freeing all nodes in a binary tree) is:
 Post-order Traversal

(Left → Right → Root)
Why Post-order?

Post-order traversal ensures that:

    You free child nodes before freeing their parent.

    This prevents accessing or freeing memory that still contains pointers to children that haven't been deallocated yet.

 Example (Concept):

void destroy_tree(TreeNode *node) {
    if (node != NULL) {
        destroy_tree(node->left);   // destroy left subtree
        destroy_tree(node->right);  // destroy right subtree
        free(node);                 // then destroy current node
    }
}

This avoids memory leaks and dangling pointers, making it the safest and correct approach for deleting trees.
