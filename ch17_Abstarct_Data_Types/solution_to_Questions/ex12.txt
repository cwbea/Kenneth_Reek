Singly Linked List for Queue:

    You need to efficiently enqueue at the rear and dequeue from the front.

    By keeping pointers to both the head (front) and tail (rear) nodes, you can perform both operations in O(1) time.

    Each node only needs one pointer (to the next node), so the memory overhead is lower.

Doubly Linked List for Queue:

    Provides two pointers per node (next and previous), which uses more memory.

    You don’t usually need to traverse backward in a queue.

    The additional complexity and memory cost don't provide significant benefits for a queue’s typical enqueue/dequeue operations.

Summary:

    Singly linked list with head and tail pointers is the most common and efficient choice for implementing a queue.

    Doubly linked lists are better when you need easy backward traversal or frequent removals from both ends, like in a deque.
