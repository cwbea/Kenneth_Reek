char *array[10];    // array is an array of 10 pointers to char
char **ptr = array; // ptr is a pointer to a pointer to char, initialized to point to array[0]

 What does ptr point to?

    array is an array of 10 char *, so array[0] is of type char *.

    ptr is a char **, initialized to point to array, which is essentially the same as &array[0].

So:

ptr == &array[0]

What happens when we do ptr + 1?

    ptr is a pointer to a pointer to a character (char **).

    Adding 1 to ptr makes it point to the next element in the array — &array[1].

So:

ptr + 1 == &array[1]

Final Answer:

    Adding one to ptr makes it point to the next pointer in the array — that is, ptr will now point to array[1].

 Summary:

Expression	Points to
ptr	&array[0]
ptr + 1	&array[1]
*ptr	array[0] (a char *)
**ptr	The first character of the string pointed to by array[0]
