a. a + ( b / c )
Simplified:
✅ a + b / c

Division has higher precedence than addition, so parentheses are unnecessary.
b. ( a + b ) / c
Simplified:
✅ (a + b) / c

Parentheses must remain because addition would otherwise happen after division.
c. ( a * b ) % 6
Simplified:
✅ a * b % 6
Multiplication and modulus have the same precedence, evaluated left to right.

d. a * ( b % 6 )
Simplified:
✅ a * (b % 6)
Cannot remove parentheses: % and * are same precedence, but original grouped b % 6 first.

e. ( a + b ) == 6
Simplified:
✅ a + b == 6
Addition has higher precedence than ==, parentheses not needed.

f. !( ( a >= '0' ) && ( a <= '9' ) )
Simplified:
✅ !(a >= '0' && a <= '9')
Logical AND (&&) has higher precedence than logical NOT (!), so inner parentheses are needed for clarity but technically not required.

g. ( ( a & 0x2f ) == ( b | 1 ) ) && ( ( ~ c ) > 0 )
Simplified:
✅ (a & 0x2f) == (b | 1) && ~c > 0
Parentheses around bitwise AND/OR comparisons stay grouped for clarity, rest simplified.


h. ( ( a << b ) – 3 ) < ( b << ( a + 3 ) )
Simplified:
✅ (a << b) - 3 < b << (a + 3)
Shift and subtraction grouped logically; outermost parentheses removed.


i. ~ ( a ++ )
Simplified:
✅ ~a++
Unary operators like ~ and ++ bind tightly, no need for parentheses.

j. ((a == 2) || (a == 4)) && ((b == 2) || (b == 4))
Simplified:
✅ (a == 2 || a == 4) && (b == 2 || b == 4)
Grouped for clarity, but can’t remove all parentheses due to operator precedence (|| and &&).

k. ( a & b ) ^ ( a | b )
Simplified:
✅ a & b ^ a | b
Bitwise operators (&, ^, |) evaluated in left-to-right order by precedence.

l. ( a + ( b + c ) )
Simplified:
✅ a + b + c
All additions are associative; all parentheses can be removed.
