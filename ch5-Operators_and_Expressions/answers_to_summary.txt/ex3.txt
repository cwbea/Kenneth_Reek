Bitwise and shifting operators in C (and other languages) are powerful tools 
used for low-level data manipulation, performance optimizations, and hardware-level 
programming. Here's a breakdown of practical uses for each:

1. Bitmasking
2. Packing and unpacking of data: embedded systems
3. Performance optimization : left shift
4. Cryptography: XOR
5. Graphics programming: Bitwise operations
6. Embedded and systems programming
7. Flags and permissions
8. Generating hash functions
