The freopen function is necessary because it allows you to redirect an existing stream 
(like stdin, stdout, or stderr) to a different file or device without closing and reopening the stream manually.

Why is this useful?

    Redirect Standard Streams Easily:

        You can redirect stdin to read from a file instead of the keyboard.

        You can redirect stdout to write to a file instead of the terminal.

    Reuse an Existing Stream:

        Instead of closing a stream and opening a new one (which might be complicated for standard streams), 
      freopen replaces the stream with a new file or device.

    Portability:

        Provides a standard way to redirect streams in C, portable across systems.

    Changing Stream Mode:

        You can change the mode of an already open stream (e.g., from read to write).

Example:

Redirecting standard output to a file:

freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
// Now all printf calls write to output.txt instead of the console.

Summary:

freopen is necessary to safely and conveniently reopen or redirect an existing file stream to another file or device 
without having to close and create a new FILE pointer manually, especially for standard streams.
