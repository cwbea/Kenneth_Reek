For most programs, it usually is not worth the extra effort to worry about whether to use fgetc(stdin) or getchar() because:

    Both functions essentially do the same thing: read one character from standard input.

    getchar() is typically just a simple macro or function that calls fgetc(stdin) internally.

    Performance differences, if any, are negligible in most practical cases.

    Code clarity and readability are more important; getchar() is simpler and more idiomatic for reading from standard input.

When might you care?
If you’re writing highly performance-sensitive or very low-level code, or dealing with different input streams (not just stdin), then using fgetc() explicitly on the desired stream is clearer and more flexible.

Summary:
For typical programs, just use getchar() for convenience and clarity — the difference is minor and usually not worth stressing over.
