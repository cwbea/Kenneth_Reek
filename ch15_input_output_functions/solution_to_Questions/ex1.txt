If the value returned from fopen is not checked for errors, the program may attempt to 
operate on a NULL file pointer, which can lead to undefined behavior â€” typically resulting 
in a crash (segmentation fault) or corrupted output.


Proper way to handle fopen:

FILE *f = fopen("data.txt", "r");
if (f == NULL) {
    perror("Failed to open file");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
// Safe to use f now
