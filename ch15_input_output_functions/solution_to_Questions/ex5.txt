When fgets() is called with very small buffer sizes, such as 1 or 2, its behavior still complies with its specification, but the actual data you can read becomes extremely limited. Here's what happens in each case:
 Reminder: How fgets() Works

char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream);

    str: buffer to store the string.

    n: maximum number of characters to read including the null terminator \0.

    stream: the input stream.

fgets() reads up to n - 1 characters or until a newline (\n) or EOF is encountered. It always null-terminates the result.
 Case 1: fgets(buffer, 1, stream)

    Only 0 characters are allowed to be stored (since 1 - 1 = 0).

    fgets() sets buffer[0] = '\0' and returns the buffer.

    No actual characters are read from the input stream.

    This is generally useless and might look like a no-op.

 Case 2: fgets(buffer, 2, stream)

    At most 1 character is read (since 2 - 1 = 1).

    fgets() puts 1 character into the buffer and adds a null terminator.

    If the next character in the stream is \n, and it gets read, the newline is included.

    Multiple calls may be needed to read an entire line.

 Example Code:

char buf[2];
while (fgets(buf, 2, stdin)) {
    printf("[%s]", buf);
}

 Input: hello\n
  Output:

[h][e][l][l][o][
]

 Summary:

Buffer Size	Max Chars Read	Effect
1	0	No characters read, buffer is '\0'
2	1	One character read, then null-terminated
Using such small buffer sizes is rarely practical unless you're deliberately reading input one character at a time.
