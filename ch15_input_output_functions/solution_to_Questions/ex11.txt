To open a file for writing without losing its former contents and allowing writing 
anywhere in the file (random access), you should use the mode:

"r+"

Explanation:

    "r+" — Open for reading and writing, starting at the beginning of the file.

        The file must exist.

        You can read and write anywhere in the file.

        The file’s existing contents are preserved (not truncated).

    Why not "w+"?

        "w+" opens for reading and writing but truncates the file to zero length immediately, destroying previous contents.

    Why not "a" or "a+"?

        "a" and "a+" open for writing (and reading in "a+") but all writes are appended at the end of the file, so you cannot write arbitrarily anywhere.

Summary table for modes regarding your requirements:

Mode	Existing Content	Random Write Access	File Creation if Not Exist
"r+"	Preserved		Yes			No
"w+"	Truncated		Yes			Yes
"a"	Preserved		No (writes append)	Yes
"a+"	Preserved		No (writes append)	Yes
So:

FILE *fp = fopen("filename.txt", "r+");
if (!fp) {
    perror("Error opening file");
    // handle error
}
// Now you can read and write anywhere in the file without losing existing contents
