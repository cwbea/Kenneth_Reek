When using the %f format specifier in C (e.g., printf("%f", value);), the last digit 
that is printed is rounded, not simply truncated.
Details:

    The default behavior of %f prints six digits after the decimal point unless you 
    specify otherwise (e.g., %.2f for two digits).

    The rounding is based on the next unprinted digit:

        If the next digit is 5 or higher, the last printed digit is rounded up.

        If it's 4 or lower, it remains the same (rounded down).

 Example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double val = 3.141592653589;
    printf("%.4f\n", val);  // Output: 3.1416
    return 0;
}

    Here, .141592... â†’ .1416 (because the 5 in the 5th decimal place causes rounding up).

 Summary:

    The last digit printed by %f is rounded, not truncated.
