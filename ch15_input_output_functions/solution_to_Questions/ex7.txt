To determine how long the buffer must be to avoid overflow from this statement:

sprintf(buffer, "%s", a);

We need to ensure the buffer is large enough to hold:

    The contents of the string a

    The null terminator \0

 Rule:

    The buffer size must be at least strlen(a) + 1 bytes.

 Explanation:

    "%s" copies the entire string pointed to by a, up to the null terminator.

    sprintf() does not automatically limit the number of characters written.

    To prevent overflow, you must know or control the length of a.

 Safe Example:

If a points to a string "hello world" (11 characters), then:

strlen(a) = 11
Required buffer size = 11 + 1 = 12

So you should declare:

char buffer[12];

 Better Practice:

To avoid overflow risks, use snprintf():

snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "%s", a);

This ensures buffer will not be overrun even if a is unexpectedly long.
