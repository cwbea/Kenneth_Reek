Example of a problem:

FILE *fp;              // Declared but not initialized
fprintf(fp, "Hello");  // Undefined behavior


This refers to using a FILE * pointer that:

    Has not been initialized (contains garbage).

    Was not set by a successful call to fopen, freopen, etc.

    Is NULL.

If I/O is attempted on a stream that has never been opened, the result is undefined behavior
 â€” the program may crash, produce corrupted output, or exhibit unexpected results.
