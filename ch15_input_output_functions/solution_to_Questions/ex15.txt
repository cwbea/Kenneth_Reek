Format code: %-6.10s

    % — start of format specifier.

    - — left-justify the output within the given field width.

    6 — minimum field width: the output will be at least 6 characters wide.

    .10 — precision: print at most 10 characters from the string.

    s — string conversion specifier.

What it means for string printing:

    Precision .10:
    Limits the number of characters printed from the string to a maximum of 10 characters.

        If the string is longer than 10 chars, only the first 10 chars are printed (string is truncated).

        If the string is shorter than or equal to 10 chars, the whole string is printed.

    Field width 6:
    The printed output will be padded with spaces if it is shorter than 6 characters.

        Since - is specified, padding will be added on the right (left-justified).

Examples:

    If the string is "Hello" (5 characters):

        Precision .10 allows full string (5 ≤ 10).

        Minimum width 6 means at least 6 spaces wide. Since string is 5 chars, 1 space is added on the right.
        Output: "Hello " (6 chars total, left-justified)

    If the string is "HelloWorld123" (13 characters):

        Precision .10 truncates to "HelloWorld" (first 10 chars).

        Length is now 10, which is more than the minimum width 6, so no padding needed.
        Output: "HelloWorld"

Summary:

%-6.10s prints up to 10 characters of a string, left-justified in a field at least 6 characters wide, 
padding spaces on the right if shorter than 6 chars.
