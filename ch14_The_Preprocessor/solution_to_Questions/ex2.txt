1. Improved Readability

Using #define gives meaningful names to values, making code easier to read and understand.

#define MAX_USERS 100

if (user_count > MAX_USERS) {
    // easier to understand than: if (user_count > 100)
}

2. Easier Maintenance

You can change the value in one place rather than hunting through code for every literal occurrence.

#define BUFFER_SIZE 256

char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
// If you later need to change the buffer size, just modify the #define
