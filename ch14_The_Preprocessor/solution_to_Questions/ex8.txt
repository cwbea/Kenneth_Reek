Problem: Circular Header Inclusion

You have two header files:
header1.h

#ifndef _HEADER1_H
#define _HEADER1_H
#include "header2.h"
other declarations
#endif

header2.h

#ifndef _HEADER2_H
#define _HEADER2_H
#include "header1.h"
other declarations
#endif

❗ What’s Wrong?

Even though you are using include guards correctly (#ifndef, #define, #endif), 
the headers include each other, which can cause problems when dependencies exist between declarations in the two files.

What Happens During Compilation?

Let’s say a .c file includes header1.h.

    The preprocessor includes header1.h

    header1.h includes header2.h

    header2.h tries to include header1.h again

    But _HEADER1_H is already defined, so the include guard prevents reprocessing, and header1.h is skipped

So far, this seems OK. BUT...

If either header relies on declarations from the other before the include completes, you will run into incomplete types or undefined symbols.
  Potential Issues:

    Incomplete type errors: if header1.h uses a type defined in header2.h, 
    but header2.h also depends on header1.h, the full definition might not be available.

    Compiler errors: especially with structs or typedefs used before their definition.

  How to Fix It

There are a few ways to avoid circular inclusion:
1. Use forward declarations instead of includes where possible.

If header1.h needs only a pointer to a type defined in header2.h, do:

// header1.h
#ifndef _HEADER1_H
#define _HEADER1_H

// Forward declaration
struct TypeFromHeader2;

void foo(struct TypeFromHeader2 *ptr);

#endif

2. Restructure your headers to break circular dependencies.

Consider moving common types/declarations into a shared header like common.h that both header1.h and header2.h can include.
3. Include headers only in source files (.c) if not absolutely needed in headers.

 Summary
Issue				Description
❌ Circular includes		header1.h and header2.h include each other
❌ Potential incomplete types	If either uses types before they are defined
✅ Use forward declarations	Prevent full dependency between headers
✅ Restructure header files	Split shared definitions into a third header

Proper header design avoids tangled dependencies and makes code easier to maintain.
