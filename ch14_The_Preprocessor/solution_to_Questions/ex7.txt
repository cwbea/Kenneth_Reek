short answer
    ❌ The macro causes undefined behavior when passed expressions with side effects like i++.

    ✅ Fix it by avoiding side effects in macro arguments or using a function instead.

Rule of thumb: Never pass expressions with side effects (like i++) to macros that use the argument more than once.


long answer 

The Problem: Side Effects and Macros

The macro:

#define SUM(value) ( (value) + (value) )

looks innocent, but it's dangerous when the argument has side effects, such as array[i++].
 What Happens Here:

In this line:

sum += SUM(array[i++]);

The macro expands to:

sum += ( (array[i++]) + (array[i++]) );

This results in i++ being evaluated twice in a single expression without an intervening sequence point. This causes:

     Undefined behavior in C.

Because:

    The C standard says you must not modify a variable more than once between sequence points.

    i++ modifies i twice, and it’s not guaranteed in what order.

 Example of What Could Go Wrong:

Suppose i = 0 and array = { 10, 20, 30 }

Expected behavior (if SUM were a function):
SUM(array[i++]) → array[0] + array[0] = 10 + 10 = 20, then i = 1

Actual behavior may vary, but could end up like:

    array[0] + array[1] = 10 + 20 = 30 and i = 2

    Or worse: unpredictable behavior or even crash

  Correct Solutions
  Use a temporary variable:

int temp = array[i++];
sum += SUM(temp);

 Or rewrite the macro safely as a function:

int SUM(int value) {
    return value + value;
}

Functions evaluate arguments only once, avoiding this entire problem.
