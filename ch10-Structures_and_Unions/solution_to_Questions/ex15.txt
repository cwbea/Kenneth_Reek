| Feature                             | **First Version** (Pointer)                            | **Second Version** (Fixed-size Array)             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **String Member**                   | `char *s;` (pointer)                                   | `char s[MAX_STRING_LENGTH];` (array)              |
| **Memory for String**               | Stores a pointer only; actual string stored elsewhere  | Allocates full array inside the union             |
| **Size of Structure**               | Smaller if strings are short or rarely used            | Larger, due to reserved space for `s[]`           |
| **String Flexibility**              | Dynamic, can point to any size (heap, etc.)            | Limited to `MAX_STRING_LENGTH` characters         |
| **String Memory Management**        | Must `malloc`/`free` (manual management)               | No need for dynamic allocation                    |
| **Order of Members** (`type` first) | Not significant functionally, but better for alignment | Better design: allows `type` to be accessed first |


The first version is more space-efficient and flexible, but requires manual memory management for strings.

The second version is easier to use and avoids manual memory management, but is less flexible and can waste memory if string variables are rare or short.
