his is a union, not a structure.

In a union, all members share the same memory.

Only one member should be used at a time, because writing to one member overwrites the others.

Only x.c has a valid value ('x').

x.a and x.b now point to corrupted or undefined data.

orrect usage of a union:

Use only one member at a time:

x.a = 25;
printf("%d\n", x.a);

or

x.b = 3.14;
printf("%g\n", x.b);
