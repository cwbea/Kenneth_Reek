1. Implementation-Dependent Memory Layout

Different compilers and architectures may lay out bit fields in memory differently:

    Bit ordering (left-to-right or right-to-left within a byte or word) can vary.

    Alignment and padding between bit fields are not standardized.

So the same bit field structure might produce different binary layouts on different systems.

2. Word Boundary Behavior Is Undefined

If a bit field spans across a storage unit boundary (e.g., across two bytes or two words), the behavior can differ:

    Some compilers allow it, others don't.

    Some insert padding; others do not.

This affects both memory layout and performance, and it can result in incorrect data interpretation on different systems.
