. On a 16-bit machine (int = 2 bytes):
Member	Offset	Size	Notes
a	0	1	char needs no alignment
	1	1	padding to align int to offset 2
b	2	2	int aligned
c	4	1	char needs no alignment
	5	1	padding to align total size to 2 bytes

 Total size: 6 bytes
 Data size: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 bytes
Wasted space: 6 - 4 = 2 bytes
  2. On a 32-bit machine (int = 4 bytes):
Member	Offset	Size	Notes
a	0	1	char needs no alignment
	1–3	3	padding to align int to offset 4
b	4	4	int aligned
c	8	1	char needs no alignment
	9–11	3	padding to align struct to 4-byte size
Total size: 12 bytes
Data size: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 bytes
Wasted space: 12 - 6 = 6 bytes
