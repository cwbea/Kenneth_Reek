✅ 1. Declaration Only (Tag Name, No Variables)

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

Purpose:

    Defines a structure type named Point.

    No variables are declared here.

    Can be used later to declare variables using:

    struct Point p1;

✅ 2. Declaration + Variable(s)

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
} p1, p2;

Purpose:

    Defines a structure type and declares variables p1 and p2 of that type.

    Useful when you need both the type and immediate variables.

✅ 3. Anonymous Structure with Variables

struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} p1;

Purpose:

    Declares a structure without a tag name (anonymous).

    Declares variable p1 of this unnamed structure type.

    You cannot declare another variable of the same structure later because it has no name.

✅ 4. Declaration with Typedef (Using typedef)

typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;

Purpose:

    Defines an anonymous structure but uses typedef to name it Point.

    You can now declare variables without the struct keyword:

    Point p1;

✅ 5. Tagged Structure with Typedef

typedef struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;
